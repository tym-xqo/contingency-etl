- SNO: 
    - point raw data access views for most tables to `swap` schema
    - clone `activities` and `answers` tables to new schema
- PG/PY: 
    - get max(id) for each of `activities` and `answers` from Snowflake
    - `copy` from Postgres `where id > $snowflake_max_id` and `copy` result into snowflake clone tables
    - [union where max(updated_at) or max(created_at) > snowflake also]
- SNO:
    - point raw data access views for `activities` and `answers` at the new clone schema
- PG/PY:
    - incremental copy remaining tables to clone in a loop
    - run hourly
